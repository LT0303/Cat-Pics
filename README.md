# Cat Pics

This is a small project meant to serve as practice using API calls and functions, async JS functions,
promises, and other JS methods and tools like selectors, event listeners, and creating elements. I also
want to continue using and practicing Axios, Flexbox, and other CSS. The site will allow users to display
cat pictures with a simple button and input forms for different kinds of pictures. I also learned to use
VS Code's built-in Publish to Github functionality to make a repository for this project.

The site uses The Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/).

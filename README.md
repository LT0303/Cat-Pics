# Cat Pics

This is a small project meant to serve as practice using API calls and functions, async JS functions,
promises, and other JS methods and tools like selectors, event listeners, and creating elements. I also
want to continue using and practicing Axios, Flexbox, and other CSS. The site will allow users to display
cat pictures with a simple button and input forms for different kinds of pictures. I also learned to use
VS Code's built-in Publish to Github functionality to make a repository for this project.

The site uses The Cat API (https://thecatapi.com/).

# Comments

After completing this project, I:

- Used async functions, try/catch statements, and DOM manipulation to append and replace created elements to a page.
- Used arrow functions to create separate functions for creating and deleting elements, then called those within an
  async function with an API call response
- Used an API call with an API key and Axios, configured headers with objects
- Debugged errors with DevTools, used DevTools to view DOM and response objects
- Used Flexbox, Google Fonts to style and organize a simple page, other CSS properties like hover transitions

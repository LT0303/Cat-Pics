# Cat Pics and GIFs

This is a small project meant to serve as practice using API calls and functions, async JS functions,
promises, and other JS methods and tools like selectors, event listeners, and creating elements. I also
want to continue using and practicing Axios, Flexbox, and other CSS. The site will allow users to display
cat pictures and GIFs with simple buttons and input forms for different kinds of pictures and GIFs separately.
I also learned to use VS Code's built-in Publish to Github functionality to make a repository for this
project. The site uses the CATAAS API (https://cataas.com/)
